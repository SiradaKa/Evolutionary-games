# Evolutionary games
**This project is a assigment for the course FFR120 Simulation of Complex Systems.**

The goal of game theory is to find best strategy to use when interacting with other agents to identify what is likely to lead to the best outcome. 

The prisonerâ€™s dilemma has two partners in crime being interrogated separately, so that they cannot communicate. They are offered a deal: they will be punished, respectively, by T and S years in prison, if they confess and testify against their partner. Betraying each other, however, will result in P years in prison for each. Cooperation and silence will only result in R years of prison for them if they keep silent.
